The Trading Signals Widget adds a sidebar gauge with the score of our proprietary risk algorithm.



== Description ==



The Trading Signals Widget (also available on our [Android Trading Signals App](http://www.my-linker.com/hop/tradingsignalsapp "Get the free Android app")) allows the WordPress site owner to add our proprietary global market risk score gauge to the sidebar of their website. The score dynamically updates each minute so long as javascript and jquery are enabled (defaults for wordpress).

The sidebar widget also contains important external links regarding the terms and disclaimer necessary for a financial information widget of this kind and *should not* be removed. The links are nofollow and go out to non-indexed pages. **The links associated with this widget should NOT be removed - if the webmaster wishes to remove the links they should not use the widget**. We have also added a link to historical datasets (also noindexed) that your page viewers can download for their own research. Cumulative recent results data is charted in timeseries plots at our new [G7 Carry Trade Index](http://www.tradingsignalsgadget.com/G7CarryTradeIndex.html "View the current chart").



== Installation ==



1. [Download tradingsignalswidget.zip](http://www.tradingsignalsgadget.com/downloads/tradingsignalswidget.zip) to your computer and unzip the contents.

2. Using cpanel or your ftp management software create a directory in your wp-content/plugins folder called tradingsignalswidget

3. Upload all the unzipped files in step one to the new `/wp-content/plugins/tradingsignalswidget` directory

4. Login to your WordPress theme admin panel and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

5. From your WordPress theme admin panel and select Appearance / Widgets and place the Risk Gauge Score in the location of your choice in your sidebar. Widget is 175px x 175px so bear that in mind when choosing an appropriate location for it. You have the option of selecting a short header title for it.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= The Gauge Has Read Zero for Several Minutes, What's Wrong with It? =



Odds are you are viewing the gadget outside normal global trading hours (a.k.a around 7pm EST Sunday through 5pm EST Friday). In some rare cases the widget may read zero for more than a minute or two, indicating a very balanced risk market globally. Be sure to refresh the page / clear the cache (CNTL-F5) to ensure you are seeing the current reading.



= How Can I change the Widget Size? =



As of this writing you can't. It automatically resizes to fit the sidebar width.



= Can I Remove the Text and Links Below the Widget? =



**No. You are NOT authorized to remove the text and links below the widget**. They contain links out to liability information which informs your site visitors as to safe usage of the information provided. The links and text are designed to protect you as site owner and your site visitors from misusing the widget.


== Screenshots ==

1. Once you have installed and activated the widget you can simply grab it from the widgets menu and add it to your sidebar - be sure to choose a good title that fits your blog's overall theme.
2. Once you have added the widget to one of your sidebars it will look something like this. Users can refresh the score manually once per minute or you can set your blog to automatically refresh (recommend 30 seconds to reduce data latency).
